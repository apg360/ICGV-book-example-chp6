This is for those who own the book and are learning it. Instead of typing all the pages of chapters 6 examples, one can copy paste this.

There are personal modifications and not 100% as in the book, a quick list :

* #### Built 100% with C and not C++. To my knowledge this is second Vulkan example in C after the GLFW examples.
* #### Removed the Windows API for window. Instead use GLFW
* #### Removed the Windows API
* #### We use Volk as Vulkan loader
* #### Use third party library for logging : dlg
